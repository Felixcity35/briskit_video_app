# =================Possible challenges=======================

# 1)  Delaying to load api content 
# 2)  loading animations in splash screen after calling Api
# 3). Managing bottom nav bar state

# ================= solution ===========================

# 1) I preload the content in application start up. 
# 2) It was a state management issue so I removed it and used the animation after login success. 
# 3) I check a sample online example of persistent bottom nav bar and used it instead.
